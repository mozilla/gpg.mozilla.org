        <h1>gpg.mozilla.org service has ended</h1>
        <p>
          gpg.mozilla.org was an OpenPGP Synchronizing Key Server (SKS) which participated
          in the global mesh of SKS servers that enabled OpenPGP users to retrieve and
          publish public keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          In June of 2019 attackers showed the ease of a certificate spamming attack that
          can poison clients' OpenPGP installations when the affected certificates are
          fetched.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robert J. Hansen, a member of the GnuPG project, was one of the people who's
          certificate was affected. He has
          <a href="https://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f">a good writeup on the incident</a>
          and the impact to the use of SKS keyservers like gpg.mozilla.org.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vulnerability is recorded in
          <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13050">CVD-2019-13050</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of this type of attack being see in the wild, the problems Robert
          Hansen identifies in his post about mitigating this vulnerability in SKS servers
          and unrelated operational challenges Mozilla has encountered in operating the
          gpg.mozilla.org SKS server, we've decided to stop hosting the gpg.mozilla.org
          SKS service as of September 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users that have configured their OpenPGP client to use gpg.mozilla.org, we
          recommend you either stop using the keyserver based features of OpenPGP entirely by removing
          the <code>keyserver</code> directive in your <code>gpg.conf</code> configuration or you
          configure your <code>gpg.conf</code> to use <code>keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org</code>
          instead. This will cause your client to use the <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">keys.openpgp.org</a>
          service as your keyserver which avoids this problem as keys.openpgp.org is not part of the keyserver network.
